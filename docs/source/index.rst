Orchest is a tool for creating data science pipelines. Orchest enables you to develop, train and run
your models on the cloud without any knowledge of cloud infrastructure.

A pipeline in Orchest can be thought of as a graph consisting of executable files within their own
isolated environment (powered by containerization). You get to describe the execution order of these
executable files through our visual pipeline editor. After coding your scripts, Orchest allows you
to select and run any subset of the pipeline whilst keeping in mind the defined execution order.

.. note::
   Orchest is in alpha.
